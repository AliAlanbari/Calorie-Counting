#Calorie Counting
This is the project that I started right after finishing my weather app, at this point I had enough experince with API to utlizie easily. This project allows the user to log their meals, it will list of the
nutrition of each food item and adds the calorie count to an updating total caloreies. Although the API I used only returned nutrition facts of each meal by the serving size of 100 grams. I gave the user the 
option to input their consumed grams, updating the nutrition and calories live along with each adjustment.
